### **Why I’m Building Loop: Solving the Chaos of Travel Planning**  

Travel planning is supposed to be exciting, right? The thrill of exploring new places, finding hidden gems, and building memories with people you care about. But more often than not, it feels like *absolute chaos.*  

I realized this during a trip I planned for seven people. Picture this: three group chats across different platforms, a spreadsheet that half the group ignored, and endless back-and-forth about where to stay and what to do. By the time we finalized plans, I was so drained that I wondered if the trip was worth the effort. Spoiler: it was, but the planning? Not so much.  

Then there’s my girlfriend. She’s always sending me Instagram posts of cozy cafés, hidden speakeasies, or dreamy restaurants she stumbles upon. I love her enthusiasm, but my “organization” boils down to a collection of screenshots buried in my phone or random bookmarks I forget about. It’s not exactly a recipe for smooth date nights.  

That’s where the idea for **Loop** came from—a travel planning app designed to simplify the chaos of organizing trips, events, and even impromptu outings.

### **Why Loop?**  

When deciding on my next project, I use three guiding principles:  

1. **Passion matters.** If I’m not excited about the subject, I’m not sticking with it.  
2. **Utility is key.** It has to work without depending entirely on user-generated content—no social media clones here.  
3. **I have to want it myself.** If I wouldn’t use it, why would anyone else?  

Loop hits all three. I’m passionate about creating solutions for real problems, it’s a tool I could see myself (and my friends) using every day, and it doesn’t rely on other people for its core value.

### **How Loop Will Help**  

**1. For Group Trips**  
Remember the seven-person trip nightmare I mentioned? Loop’s collaborative tools will make group planning easier. Everyone can vote on places, suggest activities, and see real-time updates without hunting through endless messages. No more arguments about who forgot to book the Airbnb.  

**2. For Date Nights**  
Now, when my girlfriend sends me that dreamy café post, I’ll save it to Loop with a note like *“Great for Saturday brunch!”* and pull it up later when we’re deciding where to go. Bonus: no more “What was the name of that place again?” moments.  

**3. For Solo Adventures**  
Even when I’m planning something just for me, like a weekend getaway, Loop can keep my reservations, notes, and itinerary in one place. Everything’s neat, organized, and easy to access.

### **Features to Look Forward To**  

Here’s what I’m working on for Loop’s first version:  

- **Collaborative planning**: Vote on locations, activities, and accommodations in real-time.  
- **Customizable itineraries**: Organize stops, times, costs, and notes all in one place.  
- **Location-based recommendations**: Get suggestions for restaurants, landmarks, and activities based on where you’re staying.  
- **Expense tracking**: Keep tabs on shared costs, so no one’s stuck footing the bill.  
- **Checklists and packing lists**: Never forget the essentials again.

### **The Bigger Picture**  

I don’t just want Loop to be a travel planner—I want it to feel like your ultimate trip companion. A tool that helps you stay organized, keeps everyone in the loop (pun intended), and makes the process as fun as the trip itself.  

Whether it’s planning a road trip with friends, organizing a vacation for two, or curating a list of dream cafés, Loop is my way of bringing order to the chaos and turning the stress of planning into something seamless and enjoyable.  

If you’ve ever dealt with the stress of trip planning—or if your screenshots folder looks anything like mine—I think you’ll love what I’m building with Loop. Stay tuned!
