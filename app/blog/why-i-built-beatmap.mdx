### **Why I Built BeatMap**

I built **BeatMap** because of my deep love for music. Over time, I realized that my taste in songs was often more closely tied to the producers behind the music than the artists themselves. For example, I might find myself really enjoying songs from an artist, but when I looked deeper, I realized that I actually preferred the work of the producer behind those tracks. This observation sparked the idea of creating a tool that connects artists, songs, and producers, so others could explore the same connections.

To build BeatMap, I turned to the **Genius API**, which provides detailed information on songs, artists, and producers. The API worked well, but there was one major issue that I hadn’t anticipated: the search functionality was extremely strict. If you misspelled an artist's name even slightly, the search would return no results. This was frustrating at first, but it made me realize that I needed to handle this limitation creatively in the app.

Despite the search limitations, BeatMap allowed me to dig deeper into the relationships between songs, producers, and artists. I quickly became fascinated by how interconnected the music industry really is, and how producers often shape the sound of an artist’s work. This discovery was part of a larger research project I was working on, where I wanted to explore connections between different aspects of the music industry. BeatMap was born from this curiosity, and I’m excited to continue expanding it.

This project also became an offshoot of my main research project, which I will detail more in my **Vision** post. Building BeatMap wasn’t just about creating an app; it was about uncovering new insights in music production and sharing those discoveries with others. I hope BeatMap can help people understand music in a new way, just like it has for me.
