I'm excited to announce a project I've been working since the start of the new year, **Hues**!
Hues is a color palette generator that helps you create beautiful color schemes for your projects. 
I can say for certain that I'm not the only one that spends hours trying to find the best colors for a new project.
So I built Hues to help me and others like me to quickly generate color palettes and export them in various formats.

I built Hues using **NextJS**, **Tailwind**, and **TypeScript**. 
The app uses the URL to store the color palette, so you can easily share it with others.
Building the app was a fun challenge, and I learned a lot about color theory and design principles along the way.
The app is still in its early stages, but I plan to add more features and improvements in the coming weeks and as I use it.

If you're interested in trying out Hues, you can visit the [live demo](https://hues.vercel.app) and start creating your color palettes today!

I hope you find Hues useful for your projects. Feel free to share your feedback and suggestions with me.

At the start of the new year, I had a problem: I was spending too much time picking colors for my projects. So instead of fighting it, I built something to fix it.

Thatâ€™s how Hues was born! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€

Hues is a color palette generator that makes it easy to create and share color schemes. I built it using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, and the URL stores the color palette, so sharing is seamless.

Along the way, I learned a lot about color theory, UI/UX, and tool design. And it reminded me of something important: the best projects solve problems you personally care about.

Itâ€™s still early, and I have a lot of ideas for improvements. But Iâ€™d love for you to try it out!
