At the start of the new year, I realized I was spending *way* too much time picking colors for my projects. Instead of overthinking it, I built something to fix it.  

Thatâ€™s how **Hues** was born! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€  

Hues is a color palette generator that helps you create and share beautiful color schemes effortlessly. I built it with **Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript**, and the best part? Your color palette is stored in the URL, making sharing super easy.  

Along the way, I deep-dived into color theory, UI/UX, and tool designâ€”and it reminded me why I love building things: the best projects solve problems *you* care about.  

Itâ€™s still early, but Iâ€™ve got a ton of ideas for improvements. Iâ€™d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!
