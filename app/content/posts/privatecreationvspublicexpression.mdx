blurb: What if creating didn’t need an audience to matter? Soapbox is a platform for makers who value meaning over metrics
---
Recently I've noticed that more often than not, sharing is the last step in creating something. Many of the platform used today repeat a similar mantra, *Perform, Publish, Post*, as if it isn't complete until someone validates it.  It begs the question, "Why create art if not for an audience?". 

Is art incomplete without being seen? Or is the act of making something its own reward? This is something that any one who has ever put work into creating some has asked themselves in some shape or form.  Some may argue that art is much like a asynchronous conversation, not a monologue. Others believe that the process or feeling that it offers the creator is why art exists.

For a long time, I struggled with creating things just for the sake of it especially when it came to coding. I had ideas I cared about, things I wanted to build for myself or for fun, but I’d often shut them down before I even started. Why?

Because I didn’t think anyone would care.  
Because I didn’t think it would “look good” to a recruiter.  
Because I thought if it wasn’t part of some technical checklist or job-friendly portfolio, it wasn’t worth the time.

And that mindset killed the spark.

I wasn’t building apps anymore. I was building job applications. I’d scroll past my own ideas and ask myself, _“Would this make me more hireable?”_ instead of _“Would this make me excited?”_

That’s why I started building **Aerwyrm**.

Aerwyrm is a space for learning, exploration, and play — a modular synth and sound design platform where the process is the point. It's not about likes, followers, or finished portfolios. It’s about interacting with sound, experimenting with ideas, and building a personal relationship with music and creation.

You can learn synthesis by building patches. You can sketch sonic ideas. You can break things, remix them, or leave them half-finished. There’s no publish button — just a patch and a journey.

Aerwyrm reminds me that not every project needs an audience.  
Some are built just to _be built_.  
Some teach you something you didn’t know.  
Some make you feel something.  
And that’s enough.

Because even if no one claps, it still matters that you showed up.  
That you built something meaningful.  
That you gave shape to an idea that didn’t exist before.
