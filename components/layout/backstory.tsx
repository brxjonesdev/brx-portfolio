        I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
        interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My
        favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,
        creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built
        for performance and usability.

        With a strong foundation in modern web technologies, I strive to deliver
        high-quality, maintainable code. I'm particularly interested in building
        scalable systems and collaborating with teams to solve challenging
        technical problems.

        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech, tinkering with
        music production tools, or diving into design systems. I believe in
        continuous learning and enjoy sharing knowledge with the community.
